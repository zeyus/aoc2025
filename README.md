# Dart Solutions for Advent of Code 2025

[Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2025 challenges, implemented in Dart. Each day's challenge is organized in its own directory under `bin/calendar/dec_XX.dart`, where `XX` represents the day of the month.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/zeyus/aoc2025.git
  cd aoc2025
  ```
- Ensure you have Dart installed. You can download it from [dart.dev](https://dart.dev/get-dart).
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  dart pub get
  ```
- Run a specific day's solution:
  ```bash
  dart bin/advent_of_code_2025.dart -d 1 # For Day 1
  ```

## Project Structure

- `bin/calendar/dec_XX.dart`: Contains the solution for Day XX.
- `common/`: Contains a registry (maybe some other reusable code later).
- `resources/`: Contains input files for each day's challenge.

## Contributing

Not accepting contributions, this is just for fun, and you're welcome to compare my solutions with your own, but I want to solve it myself :)
